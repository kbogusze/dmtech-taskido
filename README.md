# Task

### Main part

Create a simple REST API using Java Spring Boot that allows users to manage a single to-do list. The API should have the following functionalities:

* Create a new task: Users should be able to add a new task to the to-do list by providing the task's description and due date.

* Retrieve all tasks: Users should be able to retrieve a list of all tasks in the to-do list. List of tasks should be returned ordered by due date. Tasks with short due date should be at the top.

* Retrieve a specific task: Users should be able to retrieve a specific task by providing its unique identifier.

* Update a task: Users should be able to update the details of a task (description or due date) by providing its unique identifier.

### Important remarks

* Do as much as you can but not spend more than few hours (4h-5h) on this project. It does not have to be finished.
* Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools that you think are necessary.
* You can skip implementation of security and authorisation this time :).
* You are more than welcome to change the existing files or even start from scratch. Please stick with Java as implementation language and Spring Boot as main framework.
* Write your solution in a way that it meets your internal standards and feeling of good taste. 
* We will review the code together with you on a separate 1-hour-meeting, we will discuss design choices, and ask questions about the implementation.
* We will also introduce small change together during short pair programming session.
* Please send back the solution (or upload to Github) at least one day before scheduled meeting. We would like to have time to get familiar with the solution.
* In case of any questions feel free to contact me via e-mail (the same which send you the task).
